<P>KTM AG (formerly KTM Sportmotorcycle AG) is an Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer owned by Pierer Mobility AG and Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. ... In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes. Since 2012, KTM has been the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years.In November 2007, Bajaj Auto acquired 14.5% stake in KTM Power Sports AG (holding company of KTM Sportmotorcycles AG). The two companies have signed a cooperation deal which would see, KTM provide the know-how for joint development of the water-cooled four-stroke 125 and 250 cc engines, and Bajaj will take over the distribution of KTM products in India and some other Southeast Asian nations. The Duke 200 was a big hit among the youngsters in India and KTM has been at the forefront of a whole bunch of innovations too. The company later introduced the fully faired versions of the 200 and the 390, which again have won accolades for their riding dynamics.

<h1> BRAND NEW </h1>
<P>KTM 500cc Bike India Launch In 2022
  * The best bit is that Bajaj will make the bike in India <br>
  * The upcoming 500cc platform will spawn bikes under both KTM and Husqvarna.<br>
  * Under the KTM family, expect 500cc versions in both the Duke and Adventure range.<br>
  * The engine will be a parallel-twin cylinder liquid-cooled unit.<br>

  <p>Going by KTM’s tradition of using ‘90’ in the bike’s nomenclature, we can expect the upcoming bike to be called the KTM 490 Duke. The bike is likely to be priced at Rs 3.5 lakh and should be ideal for those looking to graduate from the venerable KTM 390 Duke. It will also serve as a more premium, power-packed alternative to the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 and the Royal Enfield Continental GT 650. </p>
